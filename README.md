CRITIC

Contemplating Relations Interactively To Improve Connections

The critic system is a framework to review entries for suitability to
a given goal or task.  It allows the user to categorize and rate the
entries.  At each point the system determines on the basis of ratings
and categorization whether the user should review items they have
already seen, rate cached items they have not, and whether to retrieve
more entries in specific categories.  This can be interfaced to
capabilities management and radar, recipe reviewing, perl module
reviewing, sources.list entry reviewing, and so on.


Here is an incomplete list of some things that Critic will be used to browse.

CPAN
apt-archives
freshmeat
sourceforge
systems (RADAR)
plans (PSE)
recipes (Gourmet)
sources.list (apt-sources)

In addition to things like these, Critic should be capable of using
collaborative filtering to make recommendations to users.  This
functionality could be used for instance to create models of people's
interest in music and videos for POSI meetings.
