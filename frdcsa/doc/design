I suppose the major purpose of critic is to do the following:

Go through a list of items and interrelate it, that is, allow the user
to view the  item if it needs  a viewer, or compare the  items if they
need  to be  compared  somehow like  "command  $item1 $item2  $item3".
Concurrently,  the  user may  apply  relations  between  the items  by
selecting  them,  perhaps in  order,  with  a  relation, and  clicking
assert, etc.  So, should have  multiple queries, etc., and the ability
to select items.
