 Everything  should  be classified  with  an  eye  to how  the  UniLang
 classifier should deal with it, down to writing specific functions for
 processing  a  given class,  etc.   That  could  be editted  from  the
 UniLang-Classification-Toolkit.

(
 Ideally this  toolkit should  be more generally  useful than  just for
 UniLang.
